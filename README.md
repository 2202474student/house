Added additional txt to README.md

Hi, please help to verify my git pull, add, commit, push concept.... Thanks.

Why we need to git pull, git add, git commit, git push?
git pull - to start a BGR - u need to sian char bor. So u need to make yourself attractive so as to "pull" the girls to you.
git add - Also known as staging. Cos when in a BGR, there will be a lot of drama....

git commit - When u plan to commit, need to go ROM and say,"I do". But better think carefully cos this will be official.

After commit, it's very troublesome to "I undo".

git push - Announce and update your latest marriage status.

Good luck ....

Don't anyhow commit...Contributed by Alex , and added by Timothy (aka Huskypower)
